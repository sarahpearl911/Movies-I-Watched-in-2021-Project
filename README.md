# Movies I Watched in 2021

## About the Project
ðŸ“½ðŸ“½ðŸ“½

I compiled information about all of the movies I watched in 2021 and used this data to analyze my movie-watching trends and create a dashboard in Tableau that shows my findings, which can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sarahpearl/viz/MoviesIWatchedin2021/Dashboard2). My goal was to take my existing knowledge about the kinds of movies I know I like and compare it with what I actually watched and how I rated what I watched, in order to see if there were any surprising trends to be found.

## My Process
ðŸ“½ðŸ“½ðŸ“½

Since I use the app, Letterboxd, to keep track of everything I watch, I already had a comprehensive list of the information I would need to complete this project. I added this information into an Excel spreadsheet, which I then loaded into BigQuery in order to complete the SQL analysis portion. The data I focused on for each movie was the movie title, the date I watched the movie, the score I gave it (out of a possible five stars), the genre, how I watched the movie (DVD or streaming service, and which streaming service it was), if this was a rewatch, the year the movie was released, the runtime in minutes, and the average rating the movie received from other Letterboxd users.

I have attached an image of the dashboard I made in Tableau below, but I highly recommend interacting with the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sarahpearl/viz/MoviesIWatchedin2021/Dashboard2)!
